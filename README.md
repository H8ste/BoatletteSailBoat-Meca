A BOM (Bill Of Materials) is available in the [Electronics info folder](https://github.com/H8ste/BoatletteSailBoat-Meca/tree/master/Electronics%20info). 


## 3D Prints 
All the STL files for 3D printing the different parts are available in the [3D Prints folder](https://github.com/H8ste/BoatletteSailBoat-Meca/tree/master/3D%20Prints). The printer used for printing was an **Ultimaker 2 Extended**. The defeault settings for most of the prints were: **20% Grid Infill , Support ON, 50Â° Overhang Angle, Plastic: PLA, 0.4 mm Nozzle**.


### Source 3D Projects for all printed parts
The 3D models were created in Tinkercad. If you want to modify the models to fit your project, the projects are available here: [Wind Vane](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/89tcWYWsKEA), [Wind Vane Mount](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/2fnjmZwuIq8), [Hatch](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/8WWAtZOIEZg), [Screwpress for Hatch](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/6mcEZHj0BVj), [Arduino & Pi Box](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/kBA1OZy1NIk), [IMU & GPS Box](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/99QlRKgLktw).
